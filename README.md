Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.

# **Q1. Development of Internet and Major Breakthrough**
As most of us have witnessed the growth of internet technology over the last 3 decades, internet technology has been an integral part of modern society, business world, health, education and almost everywhere. Our journey started with a simple messaging application to a very sophiscated applications and technology associated to internet. The Internet was introduced about fourty years ago during a research by the US millitary dubbed Arpanet.
##### *(Carolyn Duffy Marsan, **Network World Feb 9, 2009** )*
since it's introduction, the Internet has expanded exponentially and the number of users has risen from a limited computer scientists to 1.5 billion consumers.  every corner of the globe has access to the Internet, hence well  beyond the United States. Nevertheless, its popularity doesn't come alone, there is a dark side too, as it has evolved from a friendly research network to a hotbed of criminal activity including fraud and identity theft. 
##### (by Carolyn Duffy Marsan, **Network World Feb 9, 2009** )*

But originally, Arpanet was for the Advanced Research Projects Agency. Then in 1969 after the creation of Arpanet,when Arpanet was created, it connected five sites: UCLA, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, the University of Utah and BBN. In 1983, the U.S. Defense Department spun-off MILNET*, which was the part of Arpanet that carried unclassified military communications. Arpanet was renamed the Internet in 1984, when it linked 1,000 hosts at university and corporate labs.

*MILNET was later re-named the Defense Data Network and finally NIPRNET, for Non-classified IP Router Network.

## **First Major Breakthrough** *(1960-1970)* 
The introduction of Arpanet in 1969 by the US army during a research is the first notable breakthrough in Internet Technology.

Approximately 15 years after the first computers became operational, researchers began to realize that an interconnected network of computers could provide services that transcended the capabilities of a single system. At this time, computers were becoming increasingly powerful, and a number of scientists were beginning to consider applications that went far beyond simple numerical calculation 

# **Expansion of the Arpanet:** *1970-1980*
Initially conceived as a means of sharing expensive computing resources among ARPA research contractors, the ARPANET evolved in a number of unanticipated directions during the 1970s. Although a few experiments in resource sharing were carried out, and the Telnet protocol was developed to allow a user on one machine to log onto another machine over the network, other applications became more popular.

The first of these applications was enabled by the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), developed in 1971 by a group led by Abhay Bhushan of MIT (Bhushan, 1972). This protocol enabled a user on one system to connect to another system for the purpose of either sending or retrieving a particular file. The concept of an anonymous user was quickly added, with constrained access privileges, to allow users to connect to a system and browse the available files

## **From Arpanet to Internet**
Although the ARPANET was ARPA's largest networking effort, it was by no means the only one. The agency also supported research on terrestrial packet radio and packet satellite networks. In 1973, Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf began to consider ways to interconnect these networks, which had quite different bandwidth, delay, and error properties than did the telephone lines of the ARPANET. The result was TCP/IP, first described in 1973 at an International Network Working Group meeting in England. Unlike NCP, which enabled the hosts of a single network to communicate, TCP/IP was designed to interconnect multiple networks to form an Internet.
## **Local Area Networks**
Shared-media LANs became the dominant form of computer-to-computer communication within a building or local area, although variations from IBM (Token Ring) and others also captured part of this emerging market.

# **The NSFNET Years** *(1980-1990)*
During the late 1970s, several networks were constructed to serve the needs of particular research communities. These networks—typically funded by the federal agency that was the primary supporter of the research area—included MFENet, which the Department of Energy established to give its magnetic fusion energy researchers access to supercomputers, and NASA's Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN).
# **Emergence of the Web** *(1990 to the Present)*
 Coming to the early 1990s,  the Internet was already known internationally, and its operation had largely been transferred from the NSF to commercial providers. Public access to the Internet expanded rapidly thanks to the ubiquitous nature of the analog telephone network and the availability of modems for connecting computers to this network. Digital transmission became possible throughout the telephone network with the deployment of optical fiber, and the telephone companies leased their broadband digital facilities for connecting routers and regional networks to the developers of the computer network. In April 1995, all commercialization restrictions on the Internet were lifted. Although still primarily used by academics and businesses, the Internet was growing, with the number of hosts reaching 250,000. Then the invention of the Web catapulted the Internet to mass popularity almost overnight. 

Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
  - packets
  - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
  - routers and routing
  - domains and DNS

#### **Q2. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:**
  - packets
  - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
  - routers and routing
  - domains and DNS

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.** 
## *Packets*
In network technology, a packet is defined as an envelope that contains data (smallest unit of data) destined to a user according to Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network and internetworks. Two basic informations in a packet are control information and the data.
A packet:

1. *carries data*
2. *sources IP address to destination*
3. *contains parameters for aintaining service quality*
## *IP addresses (IPV4 and IPV6)*
An Internet Protocol address (IP address is a label assignedto each device connected to a network) that follows the Inetrnet protocol for data transfer.
IP address is written in human readable numeric symbol such as 255.255.172.1. IPV4 refers to 32-bit address while IPV6 uses 128-bits for IP adress. Two main functions of IP address are:
a. Identifying the host 
b. Providng the location of the host in the network.

## *domains and DNS*
Domian means a website and domain name is the address where the Internet users can access the website. A domain name is assigned to for identifying computers on the Internet.
A Domin Name System (DNS) is a standard hierarchical naming system for computers or other relevant devices connected to the Internet. DNS is equivalent to a telephone directory of domain names and DNS translate the domain names into IP addresses.
<!-- IPv4 has 32-bit address length	and IPv6 has 128-bit address length.
IPV4 Supports Manual and DHCP address configuration	whereas IPV6 supports Auto and renumbering address configuration
In IPv4 end to end connection integrity is Unachievable	and in IPv6 end to end connection integrity is Achievable
IPv4 can generate 4.29×109 address space and Address space of IPv6 is quite large and it can produce 3.4×1038 address space. -->

## *routers and routing*
A router is a networking device used to forward data packets between computer networks. Also, quite essential for internet, traffic control of data flow is also maintained by router. Router acts as a gateway and is placed at a meeting pointof two or more networks. A router inspects a packet's header's destination IP address and determines the packet's next hop.

#### **Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:**
  - TCP
  - HTTP and HTTPS
  - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

  **TCP:**

  The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the most adopted protocols of the Internet protocol suite. Initially originated in the Initial network implementation in which it to complement the Internet Protocol (IP). Therefore, the entire package is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP is responsible to deliver reliable, ordered, and error-checked stream of octets (bytes)between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, and file transfer rely on TCP. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) can be used for applications that do not require reliable data stream service.

  **HTTP and HTTPS**
  The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is regarded as the foundation of data communication tecchnology for the World Wide Web. In World wide Web, hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that is easily accessible to user. User can respond by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser or other ways.

  Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)and  is widely used for secure communication over a network.

  **web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)**
  A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application to access information available on the World Wide Web. It is a big big web  of network from all over the world. sWhen a user requests a specific website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the resulting web page on the user's device.
  HTTP Request is a packet of Information that is sent by one computer to another computer to communicate.

  Browser rendering is performed by an engine called browser rendering engine  which is a Software that renders HTML pages (Web pages). It turns the HTML layout tags in the page into the appropriate commands for the operating system.

  Developer tools are those browsers which we use to search certain website. Examples are: mozilla firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari





#### **Q4:Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.**
## Data Structures in Ruby:
3 of the ruby data structures are as below:
### Array:
An array is a collection of data in amatrix form. Each data set or string has default index starting from '0'. fro example in an array [1,3,4,5], 1 is the first element and its index is 0 whereas 5's index is 4. Array uses square brackets

### Hash:
A hash is a data dictionary where each value is assigned to its relevent key. Hash use curly bracket and the keys are always unique. For example in a hash {'a':4, 'b':1, 'c': 11}, there are three values (4,1,11) assigned to their respective keys ('a', 'b', 'c').

### Scalars:
Scalars are capable of holding single data or string. Integer, float, string, booleans are scalars. An array is an ordered list of scalars.

#### **Q5:Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.**
## Intepreters:
An interpreter is a program that copies the execution of programmes written in source code. Unlike compiler, an interpreter converts the program in line by line basis.

## Compiler:
Acompiler translates source language (high level language) into object language (machine language) and compiles the whole programme at once in contrast to interpreters.

### **Differences between a compiler and interpreter:**
1. Compiler takes an entire program i one go but interpreters does so line by line
2. Compiler generates intermediate object code but interpreter doesn't.
3. A program is compiled before execution using compiler but interpreters compiles and executes simultaneously.
4. compiler is faster than interpreter.
5. Compiler requires more memory due to the formation of object code.

#### **Q6:** Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.
I would like to discuss on Ruby and Java as these two are most dominant in software industry today.

#### **Ruby:** 
Ruby is an object oriented programming language which is almost similar to python in many ways. It is an interpreter based language which is used from web designng to data science. Developed in the 1990s,It has got the following advantages over other languages:
1. Easy to learn for the newcomers
2. Better clarity of the code for the developers
3. The coder doesn't need to be worried about the end of a statement as spacing determines it like in python. In fact, ruby is even more flexible in terms if indentation.
4. web designing is quite efficient in ruby via 'ruby on rails'
5. Unlike other programming languages, fewer codes can do a task and thus ruby is efficient in terms of memory as well. 

Ruby has the following disadvantages:
1. Lack of enough online support communities and published books unlike PHP and C#, who have extensive support communities.
2. Several benchmark websites that regularly run and test response times of programming languages frequently  complain that Ruby is a slower programming languages.
3. Ruby being a newer programming languare, is less preferred by highly experienced programmers as they like to stick to what they know very well

#### **Java:**
Java is the most widely used programming language. It is an object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling and his colleagues at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. In terms of use,  It is believed other programming languages are not even 25% as popular as Java. Some of the most popular java based applications are:
1. Eclipse
2. NASA World Wind
3. JavaFX Script & JavaFX Mobile
6. Blu-ray BD-J

Advantages of Java programming language:

1. Java is a High-level language with simple syntax and a mild learning curve.
2. Java is ideal and Standard for enterprise computing.
3. Less security rsiks compared to other programming languages, i.e provides more  security.
4. Platform-independent and compatible.
5. Being one of the most popular and old language, senior programmers prefer it.

Disadvantages of Java programming language:
1. Java is Slow. Java is comparatively slower than other popular programming languages.
2. More Memory Space required by Java compared to other programming languages3. Java is memory-consuming and significantly slower than natively compiled languages such as C or C++.
3. The default look of GUI applications  in Java using the Swing toolkit is very different from native applications.
Language Limited Latency Critical Tuning.
3. Java has  inefficient Architecture.

#### **Q8:Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language**
A program control flow (or flow of control) is the order, from the start to the end, in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of a program are executed. Control flow diagram shows the step by step operation of a program and different symbols are used for input/output (Rhombic), operation (rectangle), start (oval) and so on.
The following diagrams show the ruby code and the associated flow control diagram that has been explained after the diagrams:

![ruby](/pictures/ruby.png)

![Control flow](/pictures/flow.png) 

The start of the execution of a programme is represented by an oval shape. Inputs a and b are represented by the rhombic shapes. The operation of addition is shown next in a rectangle and the output of the operation is displayed before the end of the program.

#### **Q9: Explain type coercion**

Type coercion is the process of changing of an object's type into another type, including the value.
For exapmle when we enter input, the input is actually a string and we actually meant it to be an integer, we use the code as: variable.to_i so that the input is converted to an integer rather than a string.
Also a division involving two integers  may produce a decimal result. So, if result is the variable for the output, it should be typecasted as: result.to_f to get an accurate result. Otherwise without coersion, result will be integer until the inputs are integers.
For example, changing an Integer into a String with #to_s or a Float into an Integer with #to_i. 
some common examplles of coercion are #to_f,#to_s, #to_i, #to_a and #to_h. Some more examples: 

"mert000".to_i          # => 0

[1, 2, 3].to_s        # => "[1, 2, 3]


#### **Q10:**  Describe the data types recognised by the Ruby programming language. In your description you should give example code which uses each data type, and include the name of the Ruby classes which represent each data type.

Following are the data types in Ruby:


**Booleans:** 

bool = [true, false] # class is Symbol

adult = bool[rand(2)]


if adult
    
    puts "We will order coffee"
else 

    puts "We will order juice"
end

A boolean is a value used in a logic statement to say if the output of a certain process is considered true or false. This can be used to make decisions.
In Ruby we don’t have a Boolean class, but we have boolean objects.

**Symbols:**

example: puts "string".to_sym.class # class is Symbol 

A symbol looks like a variable name except it's prefixed with a colon. Examples - :employment, :rain. There is no need to pre-declare a symbol and they are guaranteed to be unique.

**Numbers:**
example: 
 a = 10.3 
 
 Here a is a floating point number and the class is Float
**Strings:**
 example: str = "I am a developer". Here str is a string of words and the class is string.

**Arrays:**

example: arr = [1,2,3,4,6,9]

 Here, arr is an array of integers, class is Integer

**Hashes:**
example: hash = {'a':3,'b':4, 'c':5}
 Here, a,b,c are keys with respective values 3,4 and 5. keys are String class and values are Integers.



# **Q12:**
In the given programme,
celsius = gets
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
print "The result is: "
print fahrenheit
puts "."
The first statement is incomplete. It should be gets.chomp.to_f

# **Q13:**
The correct code is as below: (ruby can also be run, q13.rb)
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
  i = i + 1 end
puts i
swapper = arr[i]
arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
arr[i + 1] = swapper
print arr

#### *Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:*
  i. Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations  
ii. Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart

The relevant algorithm for the outlined questioned is as below:
1. Start
2. Start to check from 4 (1,2,3 are already prime numbers)
3. Divide the number starting by 2
4. if the remainder is 0, mark the number as prime else divide the first number (dividend) by 3, 4 and so on until the remainder is zero or the divisor is equal to the dividend.
5. Check whether the next number is prime or not by repeating the process no. 4.
6. Repeat process number 5 until number is 99
7. Display the list of prime numbers.
