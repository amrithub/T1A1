Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.

# **Q1. Development of Internet and Major Breakthrough**
As most of us have witnessed the growth of internet technology over the last 3 decades, internet technology has been an integral part of modern society, business world, health, education and almost everywhere. Our journey started with a simple messaging application to a very sophisticated applications and technology associated to internet. The Internet technology was introduced about fourty years ago during a research by the US millitary dubbed Arpanet.
##### *(Carolyn Duffy Marsan, **Network World Feb 9, 2009** )*
The Internet has grown rapidly since its launch and the number of users has risen from a small number of computer scientists to 1.5 billion customers.
Every corner of the globe has Internet access, going far beyond the United States. Furthermore, its success does not come alone, as it has grown from a friendly research network to a hotbed for criminal activity like fraud and identity theft, there is also a dark side.
##### (by Carolyn Duffy Marsan, **Network World Feb 9, 2009** )*

But Arpanet was originally for the Advanced Projects Agency for Research. It then connected five sites in 1969 after Arpanet was created: UCLA, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, Utah University, and BBN. The United States in 1983. MILNET, which was the component of Arpanet that handled unclassified military communications, was spun-off from the Defense Department. 
In 1984, Arpanet was renamed the Internet when it connected 1,000 hosts at university and corporate laboratories. <br>
Subsequently, MILNET was re-named Defense Data Network and eventually NIPRNET, Non-classified IP Router Network.</br>

## **First Major Breakthrough** *(1960-1970)* 
Arpanet's launch by the U.S. military during a study in 1969 is the first significant advance in Internet technology.

Around 15 years after the first computers were operational, scientists began to realise that an integrated computer network was able to provide services that transcended a single system's capabilities. Computers were increasingly powerful at this time, and a number of scientists began to consider applications that went far beyond basic mathematical calculations.

# **Expansion of the Arpanet:** *1970-1980*
Initially conceived as a means of sharing costly computing resources among ARPA research contractors, during the 1970s, the ARPANET developed in a variety of unexpected directions. Although a few experiments in resource sharing were carried out, and the Telnet protocol was developed to allow a user on one machine to log onto another machine over the network,other applications became more popular.

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) developed in 1971 by a group led by MIT's Abhay Bhushan (Bhushan, 1972)permitted the first of these applications. This protocol allowed a user to connect to another device on one system in order to either submit or retrieve a particular file. The concept of an anonymous user was quickly added to allow users to connect to a system and browse the files available.

## **From Arpanet to Internet**
While the ARPANET was the biggest networking initiative by ARPA, it was by no means the only one. The organisation has funded ground packet radio and packet satellite networks studies.Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf began to consider ways of interlinking these networks in 1973 and that led to quite different bandwidth, delay and error properties than the ARPANET telephone lines did.
## **Local Area Networks**
Mutual-media LANs are now the dominant form of computer-to-computer interaction within a building or local region, though IBM (Token Ring) and other variants have also captured part of this emerging market.

# **The NSFNET Years** *(1980-1990)*
Several networks were built to serve the needs of specific research groups during the late 1970s. Such networks — typically sponsored by the federal agency that was the research area's primary supporter — included MFENet, which was set up by the Department of Energy to provide access for supercomputers to its magnetic fusion energy scientists, and NASA's Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN).
# **Emergence of the Web** *(1990 to the Present)*
 The Internet had already been known internationally until the early 1990s, and its operation had been largely transferred from the NSF to commercial providers. Due to the ubiquitous nature of the analogue telephone network and the availability of modems for connecting computers to this network, public Internet access has expanded rapidly. With the introduction of optical fibre, electronic communication became available throughout the telephone network, and telephone companies leased their virtual broadband facilities to link routers and regional networks through computer network developers. All Internet marketing restrictions were lifted in April 1995. Although still primarily used by academics and businesses, the Internet was growing, with the number of hosts reaching 250,000. Then the invention of the Web catapulted the Internet to mass popularity almost overnight. 


#### **Q2. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:**
  - packets
  - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
  - routers and routing
  - domains and DNS

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.** 
## *Packets*
In network technology, a packet is defined as an envelope that contains data (smallest unit of data) destined to a user according to Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network and internetworks. Two basic informations in a packet are control information and the data.
A packet:

1. *carries data*
2. *sources IP address to destination*
3. *contains parameters for aintaining service quality*
## *IP addresses (IPV4 and IPV6)*
An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a tag assigned to each networked device that follows the data transfer protocol inetrnet.
IP address in human readable numerical symbol such as 255.255.172.1 is written. IPV4 refers to a 32-bit address whereas IPV6 uses IP address 128-bit. Two big IP address features are:
a. Identifying the host 
b. Providng the location of the host in the network.

## *domains and DNS*
Domain means a website and the description of the domain is the address that Internet users can access the website. To identify computers on the Internet, a domain name is assigned.
A Domin Name System (DNS) for computers or other related devices connected to the Internet is a generic hierarchical naming system. DNS is the equivalent of a domain name telephone directory and DNS converts the domain name into IP addresses.

<!-- IPv4 has 32-bit address length	and IPv6 has 128-bit address length.
IPV4 Supports Manual and DHCP address configuration	whereas IPV6 supports Auto and renumbering address configuration
In IPv4 end to end connection integrity is Unachievable	and in IPv6 end to end connection integrity is Achievable
IPv4 can generate 4.29×109 address space and Address space of IPv6 is quite large and it can produce 3.4×1038 address space. -->

## *routers and routing*
A router is a networking device used to forward data packets between computer networks. Also, quite essential for internet, traffic control of data flow is also maintained by router. Router acts as a gateway and is placed at a meeting pointof two or more networks. A router inspects a packet's header's destination IP address and determines the packet's next hop.

#### Q3.**Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:**
  - TCP
  - HTTP and HTTPS
  - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

  **TCP:**

  The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the most adopted protocols of the Internet protocol suite. Initially originated in the Initial network implementation in which it to complement the Internet Protocol (IP). Therefore, the entire package is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP is responsible to deliver reliable, ordered, and error-checked stream of octets (bytes)between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, and file transfer rely on TCP. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) can be used for applications that do not require reliable data stream service.

  **HTTP and HTTPS**
In distributed, shared, hypermedia information systems, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol. It is considered the cornerstone of the World Wide Web's data communication technology. Hypertext files in the World Wide Web contain hyperlinks to other user-friendly tools. Users can respond by clicking a mouse or tapping the screen in a web browser or other manner. 

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that is commonly used for secure network communication.

  **web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)**
  A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a World Wide Web-based software programme for accessing information. It's a big network internet from around the world. When a user requests a specific website, the web browser must download the appropriate content from a web server and then view the corresponding web page on the computer of the user.

  HTTP Request is a data packet that is sent to another device for communication by one computer.

  Browser rendering is performed by a browser rendering engine, a software that makes HTML (Web pages) pages. This converts the page's HTML template tags into the operating system's correct commands.
  
  Developer tools are those browsers which we use to search certain website. Examples are: mozilla firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari





#### **Q4:Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.**
## Data Structures in Ruby:
3 of the ruby data structures are as below:
### Array:
An array is a collection of data in amatrix form. Each data set or string has default index starting from '0'. fro example in an array [1,3,4,5], 1 is the first element and its index is 0 whereas 5's index is 4. Array uses square brackets

### Hash:
A hash is a data dictionary where each value is assigned to its relevent key. Hash use curly bracket and the keys are always unique. For example in a hash {'a':4, 'b':1, 'c': 11}, there are three values (4,1,11) assigned to their respective keys ('a', 'b', 'c').

### Scalars:
Scalars are capable of holding single data or string. Integer, float, string, booleans are scalars. An array is an ordered list of scalars.

#### **Q5:Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.**
## Intepreters:
An interpreter is a program that copies the execution of programmes written in source code. Unlike compiler, an interpreter converts the program in line by line basis.

## Compiler:
Acompiler translates source language (high level language) into object language (machine language) and compiles the whole programme at once in contrast to interpreters.

### **Differences between a compiler and interpreter:**
1. Compiler takes an entire program i one go but interpreters does so line by line
2. Compiler generates intermediate object code but interpreter doesn't.
3. A program is compiled before execution using compiler but interpreters compiles and executes simultaneously.
4. compiler is faster than interpreter.
5. Compiler requires more memory due to the formation of object code.

#### **Q6:** Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.
I would like to discuss on Ruby and Java as these two are most dominant in software industry today.

#### **Ruby:** 
Ruby is an object oriented programming language which is almost similar to python in many ways. It is an interpreter based language which is used from web designng to data science. Developed in the 1990s,It has got the following advantages over other languages:
1. Easy to learn for the newcomers
2. Better clarity of the code for the developers
3. The coder doesn't need to be worried about the end of a statement as spacing determines it like in python. In fact, ruby is even more flexible in terms if indentation.
4. web designing is quite efficient in ruby via 'ruby on rails'
5. Unlike other programming languages, fewer codes can do a task and thus ruby is efficient in terms of memory as well. 

Ruby has the following disadvantages:
1. Lack of enough online support communities and published books unlike PHP and C#, who have extensive support communities.
2. Several benchmark websites that regularly run and test response times of programming languages frequently  complain that Ruby is a slower programming languages.
3. Ruby being a newer programming languare, is less preferred by highly experienced programmers as they like to stick to what they know very well

#### **Java:**
Java is the most widely used programming language. It is an object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling and his colleagues at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. In terms of use,  It is believed other programming languages are not even 25% as popular as Java. Some of the most popular java based applications are:
1. Eclipse
2. NASA World Wind
3. JavaFX Script & JavaFX Mobile
6. Blu-ray BD-J

Advantages of Java programming language:

1. Java is a High-level language with simple syntax and a mild learning curve.
2. Java is ideal and Standard for enterprise computing.
3. Less security rsiks compared to other programming languages, i.e provides more  security.
4. Platform-independent and compatible.
5. Being one of the most popular and old language, senior programmers prefer it.

Disadvantages of Java programming language:
1. Java is Slow. Java is comparatively slower than other popular programming languages.
2. More Memory Space required by Java compared to other programming languages3. Java is memory-consuming and significantly slower than natively compiled languages such as C or C++.
3. The default look of GUI applications  in Java using the Swing toolkit is very different from native applications.
Language Limited Latency Critical Tuning.
3. Java has  inefficient Architecture.

#### Q7. **Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue**
Among the given list, I'd like to choose the following issues:

1. intellectual property, copyright, and acknowledgement:
Intellectual property is protected by laws specific to the expression of an idea. Copyright is the law specific to the expression of ideas in visual or audio form. Unlike a trademark that indicates a specific item or design is protected, copyright covers a different expression of thought.
As an IT professional, one should be quite aware of the copyright rules and regulatoins regarding the use of any other's idea. 
Intellectual property rights include patents, copyright, industrial design rights, trademarks, plant variety rights, trade dress, geographical indications, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets.
Being an IT professional and specifically  talking about intellectual property regarding software and other IT products, Software copyright is used by Software Developers and proprietary software companies to prevent the unauthorized copying of their software. Free and open source licenses also rely on copyright law to enforce their terms. For instance, copyleft licenses impose a duty on licensees to share their modifications to the work with the user or copy owner under some circumstances. No such duty would apply had the software in question been in the public domain. To use other's creativity or design is the violation of intellectual property. The moment an idea or creative concept is documented on paper or electronically it is automatically protected by copyright in Australia. In Australia, copyright law is governed by the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (Copyright Act), and is administered by the Department of Communications and the Arts.Intellectual property (IP) and other intangible assets that relate to doing business include patents, trade marks, designs, and secret processes and formulae (Copyright Act Australia, 1968).
2. criminal acts such as theft, fraud, trafficking and distribution of prohibited



#### **Q8:Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language**
A program control flow (or flow of control) is the order, from the start to the end, in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of a program are executed. Control flow diagram shows the step by step operation of a program and different symbols are used for input/output (Rhombic), operation (rectangle), start (oval) and so on.
The following diagrams show the ruby code and the associated flow control diagram that has been explained after the diagrams:

![ruby](/pictures/ruby.png)

![Control flow](/pictures/flow.png) 

The start of the execution of a programme is represented by an oval shape. Inputs a and b are represented by the rhombic shapes. The operation of addition is shown next in a rectangle and the output of the operation is displayed before the end of the program.

#### **Q9: Explain type coercion**

Type coercion is the process of changing of an object's type into another type, including the value.
For exapmle when we enter input, the input is actually a string and we actually meant it to be an integer, we use the code as: variable.to_i so that the input is converted to an integer rather than a string.
Also a division involving two integers  may produce a decimal result. So, if result is the variable for the output, it should be typecasted as: result.to_f to get an accurate result. Otherwise without coersion, result will be integer until the inputs are integers.
For example, changing an Integer into a String with #to_s or a Float into an Integer with #to_i. 
some common examplles of coercion are #to_f,#to_s, #to_i, #to_a and #to_h. Some more examples: 

"mert000".to_i          # => 0

[1, 2, 3].to_s        # => "[1, 2, 3]


#### **Q10:**  Describe the data types recognised by the Ruby programming language. In your description you should give example code which uses each data type, and include the name of the Ruby classes which represent each data type.

Following are the data types in Ruby:


**Booleans:** 

bool = [true, false] # class is Symbol

adult = bool[rand(2)]


if adult
    
    puts "We will order coffee"
else 

    puts "We will order juice"
end

A boolean is a value used in a logic statement to say if the output of a certain process is considered true or false. This can be used to make decisions.
In Ruby we don’t have a Boolean class, but we have boolean objects.

**Symbols:**

example: puts "string".to_sym.class # class is Symbol 

A symbol looks like a variable name except it's prefixed with a colon. Examples - :employment, :rain. There is no need to pre-declare a symbol and they are guaranteed to be unique.

**Numbers:**
example: 
 a = 10.3 
 
 Here a is a floating point number and the class is Float
**Strings:**
 example: str = "I am a developer". Here str is a string of words and the class is string.

**Arrays:**

example: arr = [1,2,3,4,6,9]

 Here, arr is an array of integers, class is Integer

**Hashes:**
example: hash = {'a':3,'b':4, 'c':5}
 Here, a,b,c are keys with respective values 3,4 and 5. keys are String class and values are Integers.


#### *Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?”*
  - Identify the classes you would use to solve the problem
  - Write a short explanation of why you would use the classes you have identified


# **Q12:**
In the given programme,
celsius = gets
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
print "The result is: "
print fahrenheit
puts "."
The first statement is incomplete. It should be gets.chomp.to_f

# **Q13:**
The correct code is as below: (ruby can also be run, q13.rb)
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
  i = i + 1 end
puts i
swapper = arr[i]
arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
arr[i + 1] = swapper
print arr

#### *Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:*
  i. Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations  
ii. Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart

The relevant algorithm for the outlined questioned is as below:
1. Start
2. Start to check from 4 (1,2,3 are already prime numbers)
3. Divide the number starting by 2
4. if the remainder is 0, mark the number as prime else divide the first number (dividend) by 3, 4 and so on until the remainder is zero or the divisor is equal to the dividend.
5. Check whether the next number is prime or not by repeating the process no. 4.
6. Repeat process number 5 until number is 99
7. Display the list of prime numbers.
8. End the program.
